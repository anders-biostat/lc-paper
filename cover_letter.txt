Dear Editor

Plots and charts are a core component of most scientific publications. Sometimes, a chart directly depicts raw data, as it was measured, but more often than not, the plotted data is the result of a complex analysis procedure that has condensed a large amount of raw data into a small set of summary values. 

Reviewers and readers are then expected to trust that these summarizations have been performed correctly. Furthermore, the figure in the paper will only offer one of many possible views onto the data. A reader interested in other aspects would have to recreate the whole analysis using the description in the methods section and the available raw data. Both issues are crucial hindrances towards more open and transparent science, and approaches to overcome them are urgently needed.

In the present manuscript, we discuss the concept of "Linked Charts": Imagine, the summarizing figures in a paper were interactive, such that the viewer could select (e.g., by mouse click) a data point to inspect: then, another "details chart" linked to it could appear and display the underlying detailed data, that gave rise to the selected data point -- thus going one (or several) steps "backwards" in the analysis. 

In the present manuscript, we argue that such "linking" of interactive charts is a powerful concept to make analyses more transparent, more easily understandable and verifiable. "Linking" is of value not only at the end of a research project, to present the results to the scientific community, but also when constructing the analysis pipeline, to explore the data, to gain insights into the analysis process, and to notice and avoid errors.

**We present "R/LinkedCharts", a framework for the popular data-science platform, R, that renders radically simple the setting up such interactively linked charts. With our framework, bioinformatics practitioners will find setting up linked interactive visualization to be as convenient and easy as generating usual static plots.**

LinkedCharts fills a crucial gap in the toolbox of data science of special interest to life sciences: Of course, there already are plenty of tools to interactively visualize data, but usually only in a manner tailored to a single specific use case or a single specific data type. On the other hand, there are extremely general frameworks that allow experienced software developers to produce arbitrarily complex data visualizations, at the cost of considerable effort. We have closed the gap in the middle, by developing a powerful, general, but very simple framework, allowing for rapidly putting together interactive data-exploration apps.

The novelty and great utility of our tool is based on the concept of "linking" charts. We demonstrate with several examples that this approach is particularly suited to the style of data analysis typically encountered in the life sciences. We show that it helps building bridges over the communication gap between bioinformaticians and wet-lab biologists, and that it offers a novel approach to improving openness and transparency in big-data research.

Therefore, we feel that our work might be of great interest to your readers.

With best regards

Simon Anders and Svetlana Ovchinnikova
