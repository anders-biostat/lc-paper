# Introduction

* Interactivity is an important tool when it comes to visualizing big data.
* Interactivity is commonly used for presentation final results to the reader.
* However, it is underused during the analisys.
* Though there are lots of packages that provide interactive inside into the most common data types, visualization of complex data still reuquire a considerable effort.
* We explore the idea of linking multiple charts together to create a powerful yet easy to use workframe to generate both quick and dirty interactive solutions for on-the-fly vizualizations, and prettified server apps.

# Linking charts

* Example with oral cancer + code. 
* Figure D.
* Emphasis on the on_click callback.

# Workflow overview

* Figure C

# Syntax and structure

* Figure B (?) - to emphasize the simplicity of the code.
* Example with correlation heatmap. Another figure (?)
* Figure A - all available functions.
* Input forms

# Discussion

* Mention journals like F1000 (with interactive figures)
* Server apps
